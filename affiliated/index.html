	<h1>Affiliated Packages</h1>

	<p>A major part of the Astropy Project is the concept of “Affiliated Packages”. An affiliated package is an astronomy-related Python package that is not part of the astropy core package, but has requested to be included as part of the Astropy Project community. These packages demonstrate a commitment to Astropy’s goals of improving reuse, interoperability, and interface standards for Python astronomy and astrophysics packages.</p>

	<p>If you are developer interested in signing up as an affiliated package, details are at the <a href="#affiliated-instructions">end of this page.</a></p>

	</section>

	<section id="installing">

	<h1>Installing Affiliated Packages</h1>

	<p>  The simplest way to install and keep up-to-date most affiliated packages is to use the <a href="https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda">Anaconda python distribution</a>.  This distribution provides Astropy built-in, and affiliated packages are available from a  "channel" <a href="https://github.com/astropy/conda-channel-astropy">maintained by the Astropy community</a>.  You can see  the affiliated packages in the channel <a href="https://anaconda.org/astropy/packages">here</a>, and if you have anaconda installed, you can do <code>conda search -c astropy some_affiliated_package</code>.  Most importantly, you can then install them with <code>conda install -c astropy some_affiliated_package</code>. </p>

	<p> If you do not have Anaconda or wish to install from source, for most affiliated packages, downloading the source code and doing <code>python setup.py install</code> will work.  Many also support the Astropy core package's additional build and install options, as they use the affiliated package template (detailed more <a href="#affiliated-instructions">below</a>). That said, affiliated packages are developed independently of the Astropy core library.  This means they are free to develop their packages as they see fit, and can have a variety of different requirements or  unusual install procedures.  Hence you should refer to the package's documentation first if you encounter problems.</p>

	<section id="affiliated-package-registry">
	  <h1>Affiliated Packages Registry</h1>
	  <p>The following table lists all currently registered affiliated packages. They are determined from the <a href="http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/registry.json">json file</a>, which is the actual authoritative registry.</p>

	<h3><u>Other astronomy packages</u></h3>

	<p>This section lists some packages that are not affiliated pacakges, but are useful reference (i.e. precursors, overlapping in functionality, etc). </p>

	<ul>
	<li> <a href="http://packages.python.org/Astropysics/">astropysics</a>: A library of assorted optical astronomy and astrophysics tools.  A "precursor" of sorts, in the process of getting ported to Astropy.</li>
	<li> <a href="http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/">kapteyn</a>: A library primarily concerned with celestial coordinates and other transformations. Provided some of the inspiration for astropy's coordinates package. </li>
	</ul>

	</section>

	<section id="affiliated-instructions">

	<h1>Becoming an Affiliated Package</h1>

	<p>If you are a developer of an astronomy package and would like your package to become affiliated with the Astropy Project, leave a message on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/astropy-dev">astropy-dev</a> group requesting affiliated package status.  If you are comfortable doing so, you should also create a pull request adding your package to the registry file on the <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy.github.com">github repository for this web site</a>.  The Astropy coordination commitee and community will then consider your package based on the standards below. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>It should use <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/">classes and functions from the astropy package</a> wherever possible and appropriate. This facilitates re-use of code and sharing of resources.  </li>

		<li>The package should have documentation that adequately explains the use of the package, at standards comparable to astropy. Additionally, user-facing classes and functions should all have docstrings. We suggest using sphinx, with the numpydoc-like <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/docguide.html">docstring standards used by astropy</a>, but this is not a strict requirement as long as the documentation is of comparable quality.</li>

		<li>The package should make a best-effort to include an easy-to-run test suite that covers its intended functionality. We realize this is not always possible, but when it is, a test suite is a crucial element of stable software and reproducible science.</li>

		<li>The package developer(s) should make an effort to connect with the Astropy developer community, including developers from  the core astropy package or any related affiliated packages.</li>

		<li>While not a strict requirement, we also provide <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/codeguide.html">coding guidelines</a> that will make your code easier to read by members of the community.</li>

		<li>We strongly encourage affiliated packages be compatible with Python 3.x. Tips for how to achieve this are given in the <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/codeguide.html#writing-portable-code-for-python-2-and-3"> revelant section of the coding guidelines</a>. The recommended route is to use the <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/six/">six</a> package.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>


	<p>If your package is judged by the coordination committee to meet these
	standards, it will be added to the affiliated package registry. Note however
	that if packages become unmaintained or do not meet the standards anymore,
	they may be removed from the list of affiliated packages.</p>

	<h2>Affiliated Package Template</h2>
	<p>If you are considering creating a new astronomy package and would like it to be an Astropy affiliated package, we provide a <a href="https://github.com/astropy/package-template">package template</a> to make it much easier to meet these standards. It provides the necessary structure to generate documentation like that used in the astropy package, a ready-to-use testing framework, and a variety of tools that streamline tasks like user configuration, caching downloaded files, or linking C-compiled extensions. More details on this template are available in the <a href="https://github.com/astropy/package-template/blob/master/README.rst">usage instructions for the template</a>.
	</p>
<p>We recommend that you join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/astropy-affiliated-maintainers">astropy-affiliated-maintainers</a> mailing list to be kept informed of updates to the package template, as well as to have any dicussions related to setting up affiliated packages.</p>
